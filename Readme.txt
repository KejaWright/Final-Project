        >This is a website that will lead to a game called "Jitterbug Cafe: Mini Coffee Shop". In this game, people will
        create an account in order to play the game. The game will have 5 levels (for now) and will increase with difficulty. More info about the
        game can be read through the rules of the game once you have signed up and logged in (which will auto direct you to the game afterwards).
        Essentially a leaderboard that will display other's scores including your own. Account can be signed out or deleted in the "account"
        section. Click "About this Project" to see bug report.
