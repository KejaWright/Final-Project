        >This is a website that will lead to a game called "Jitterbug Cafe: Mini Coffee Shop Simulator". In this game, people will
        create an account in order to play the game. The game will have 5 levels (for now) and will increase with difficulty. There
        will be a tutorial page that will not garner a score. The score for the other levels will accumulate and give a play a rank
        based on the total score (all 5 levels combined). Ranks A-D. Essentially a leaderboard that will display other's scores including
        your own. This score will be reset every week essentially.
